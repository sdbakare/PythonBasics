#Python Program for Sum of squares of first n natural numbers
#Given a positive integer N. The task is to find 12 + 22 + 32 + â€¦.. + N2

#Method 1: O(N) The idea is to run a loop from 1 to n and for each i, 1 <= i <= n, find i2 to sum.

def SquareSum(n):
    sm = 0

    for i in range (1, n+1):
        sm = sm + (i * i)
    return sm


#Driver Code
n = 4

print (SquareSum(n))
