# Python3 program to add two numbers with user input

number1 = input("Enter first number in your mind:")
number2 = input("\nEnter second number in your mind:")

# Adding two numbers
# User might also enter float numbers

sum = float(number1) + float(number2)

# Display the sum
# will print value in float

print("the sum of {0} & {1} is {2}".format(number1,number2, sum))
